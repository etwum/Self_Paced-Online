This is my fork of UW's Self-Paced Python course that I paid >$1000 for.
I hope it's worth it. Dear god, I hope it's worth it.

I'm 23 and graduated w/ a degree in Pure Mathematics.
I've been at my first job since Sept 2016 and it is so boring. I'm hoping the coding skills I learn through this course will take me to a job that's actually interesting.
